            <h5 id="headercenter"> New Horizons</h5>
              <p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons, available on Nintendo Switch, offers players a full-fledged and immersive gaming experience.

The game operates in real-time, mimicking the time and seasons of the real world, bringing a sense of immersion and progression to the player's island life.

              <h5 id="headercenter">Pocket Camp</h5>
              <p>On the other hand, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, available on mobile devices, offers a more streamlined and compact gameplay experience. Players take on the role of a campsite manager, where they can customize and decorate their campsite, as well as build relationships with animal visitors. The game follows a time-based cooldown system, where players can fulfill requests from visiting animals to earn rewards and craft furniture items. Pocket Camp focuses on bite-sized tasks and is designed for short play sessions on the go, making it ideal for players who prefer a casual and mobile gaming experience.</p>

              <h5 id="headercenter">Pocket Camp</h5>
              <p>In contrast, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp offers a more limited scope for customization. While players can decorate their campsite and camper van with furniture and accessories, the design options are more straightforward compared to New Horizons. Additionally, players can change their character's appearance and outfit, but the level of customization is not as extensive as in the console version.</p>

          <h4>Multiplayer and Social Interaction</h4>
