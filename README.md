# Bootstrap
## What I learned/practiced: 
The purpose of this assignment was to create a website using Bootstrap. I learned many things, mostly the fact that I will try to stay as far away from Bootstrap as I possibly can, but also that it has some helpful techniques once you can understand them.

### Column Setup
Instead of being able to use CSS ```display: grid;```, with Bootstrap you use the syntax provided by the framework. Different columns have set parameters for their size. For example, I wanted a row of three columns so I created a ```div``` and used ```class col-4```, ```<div class="col-4">```. This allowed for four columns to span the width of the page. The [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) has many helpful articles when it comes to understanding the specific columns you will want to use.

After figuring that out and getting it set up, I used similar techniques and formatting for the columns as I would in ```display: grid;```. It was the only part of Bootstrap that I used as I prefer to create the CSS myself. I found Bootstrap too restrictive to achieve the design I wanted.

I also noticed that using Bootstrap, floating an image worked better than just having the image set with CSS. This could be because I was working with the bootstrap column structure. 

### Navbar
For this navbar, I used a similar navbar that I used on a different assignment. This navbar uses active properties to add lines when hovering over. The navbar has multiple parts that I followed a Codepen for, and it has an active selector using the ```::before``` and ```::after``` pseudo-class elements to show different actions at different times. 

The ```::before``` element is used to code the state of the navbar before it is interacted with, while the ```::after``` element is used after an interaction like hovering. 

ex. ```div.topBotomBordersOut a:before, div.topBotomBordersOut a:after{```

It also uses the transform property to show how far off of the x-axis the lines are going. 
ex. ```transform: translateY(10px);``` 

I used this element in tandem with the transition property to make sure it would transition the lines seemly.
ex.```transition: all 0.3s;```

After this, changing the opacity, and making sure the header was correctly working, I was done!  In the future, I will experiment more with using the Navigation available in the Bootstrap Framework.

### Background Images
During the assignment, I also tried using a background image for the homepage header. It was a bit of a challenge to find an image that would be the correct size, but I finally got what I was looking for. I also used the CSS property ```background-repeat: no-repeat;``` to make sure the image only showed once. I struggled a bit with linking the photo, but finally discovered that because the  'Images' folder was the root directory, I could use ```background-image: url('../images/animalcrossingbanner2.jpg');``` which works great!
